# discord-call-time
Get the total call time from you and another discord user
This is a self-bot and can your discord account getting banned, but since discord has no built in feature for it, i diceded to do it anyways.
I am not responsible if your account gets banned.

Some call messages are bugged and you have to look through the output to identify them and subtract them from the result.
